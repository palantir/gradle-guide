  * Gradle lifetime
  * Caching
  * Separating code + data changes
  * Tasks
  * Extensions
  * Configurations + Dependencies

* Automated checks for Gradle plugin gotchas, with links to the guide
    * .stripIndent(true) in tests
    * Avoid file in then: blocks/assertions
    * create vs register
    * Use of AutoParallelizable
    * abstract class es for tasks/extensions
    * Propertys everywhere
    * Avoiding dependsOn
    * Avoiding afterEvaluate
    * .stream() rather than configureEach on lazy collections
    * Testing against multiple gradle versions?
    * Enforcing plugins do not have ‘gradle’ in the name
    * Enforcing artifacts start with gradle- in the name
    * Artifacts have group beginning com.palantir.gradle
    * groovy vs java source sets
    * Project spec bad, built in test kit bad
    * ExtensionAware instead of creating nested extensions
    * Dependencies on settings plugins wrecking buildscript
    * Dependencies in buildSrc wrecking everything
    * Resources.getResource in gradle plugin
    * Dependencies in settings plugins
    * Use of buildSrc
    * Overlaps between classpath of settings.gradle/buildSrc/buildscript
    * Action only - autogenerated Closure overload
    * DomainObjectSet etc for project configuration vs Properties

* Random stuff
  * Module metadata bad
